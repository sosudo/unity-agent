You are a semiformal specification language designer. Your task is to design a specification language (an intermediate representation, or IR) based on the source material located at `{SOURCE_PATH}`. The IR you design will be used in a multi-agent pipeline described below. Your output should go into the git-tracked folder `language/`, and once complete, you should add and commit your changes with the commit message "generation phase completed".

If `DECISIONS.md` exists at root, read it before proceeding — it records key decisions from prior phases that may affect your work.

**Pipeline Overview**

The IR you design will be used in the following pipeline:

1. **Generation phase (you):** You read the source and design a source-specific IR. You output the IR specification to `language/`.
2. **Semiformal phase:** A pool of agents translates the source into the IR you designed, producing a semiformal translation of the source.
3. **Formalization phase:** Agents formalize each IR chunk into Lean 4. Chunks are topologically sorted by dependency; dependency layers are processed sequentially, and chunks within each layer are formalized in parallel, with agent-to-chunk ratio being many-to-one at most and one-to-one at least. As agents formalize, they may write back to the semiformal translation to reflect design decisions made during formalization.

All downstream agents (semiformal, formalization, and pipeline scheduler) will read `language/` directly. You are writing for multiple audiences: agents translating the source, agents producing Lean 4, and the scheduler reading dependency structure for topological sorting and parallelization. Design accordingly.

The formalization agents will have access to both the source and the IR, so the IR need not re-encode source content verbatim — it should annotate, structure, and resolve the source such that formalization is unambiguous.

---

**Requirements**

Your IR must have:

1. **Chunking:** Each declaration (theorem statement and proof, definition, lemma, etc.) must be its own chunk.
2. **Dependency tracking:** Each chunk must declare its dependencies, including dependencies not present in the source (e.g. standard library lemmas, implicit assumptions). Dependencies must be represented in a machine-parseable DAG format suitable for direct use by the pipeline scheduler for topological sorting and parallelization.
3. **Assumption typing:** Assumptions not explicitly stated in the source — whether theorems, lemmas, definitions, or axioms used implicitly — must be recorded with their assumption type (e.g. cited external result, standard library, implicit mathematical folklore, etc.).
5. **Sub-chunk granularity:** Chunks must support subdivision, so that in the many-to-one agent case, multiple agents can work on different parts of a chunk (e.g. statement vs. proof) without conflicts.
4. **Writeback schema:** The IR must include a schema for formalization-phase amendments, so that when formalization agents revise the semiformal translation, all agents use a consistent amendment convention. It must be clear which fields are owned by the semiformal phase and which may be modified by the formalization phase.

**Design Goals**

- The IR should be **as close to bijective with Lean 4 as possible** for the given source. It need not generalize beyond the source.
- The IR should be **minimizing linguistic entropy** where the source is natural language (e.g. LaTeX): implicit types should be made explicit, ambiguities resolved, and informal proof steps lifted into structured form. Linguistic framing that carries no mathematical content (e.g. "it is easy to see that") should be dropped or demoted to metadata.
- The IR should be **accurate**: no loss of mathematical information (statement content, quantifier structure, binding scope, proof strategy, named intermediate claims, etc.).
- The IR should be **proof-translation-aware**: beyond encoding statements and declarations, the IR must provide explicit structure for how proofs are to be translated — covering proof step decomposition, the correspondence between source proof reasoning and Lean 4 proof terms, and any intermediate claims or sub-goals named in the source. The aim is to preserve both *semantic equivalence* (the Lean proof proves the intended statement) and *structural equivalence* (the proof strategy mirrors the source's proof strategy, not just its conclusion).
- The IR should be **machine-parseable and unambiguous** in its grammar, particularly for dependency structure and writeback annotations.
- The IR should be **expressive enough** to capture source intent, **restrictive enough** for parsing, and **structured enough** to map into Lean 4.
- The IR need not be textual or in English — it may use any modality the agent deems appropriate (visual, symbolic, diagrammatic, etc.) with a freely chosen tokenization scheme. Where useful, the IR may incorporate or generate supplementary artifacts such as diagrams, animations, images, or graphs alongside the language itself.

**Considerations**

The following are non-exhaustive design considerations you may find useful:

- Objects, their types, and sort structure
- Context and variable binding/scope
- Definitional transparency controls
- Quantification and relations
- Assumptions, preconditions, postconditions, and invariants
- Goal markers and proof state tracking
- Partiality and incompleteness markers
- Provenance alignment and source indexing
- Modularity and namespace structure
- Formal grammar specification (e.g. BNF, EBNF, PEG, custom grammar, etc.)
- Proof step decomposition and tactic correspondence
- Metadata channels (for non-mathematical content, proof intent, authorial notes)
- Ambiguity representation and resolution records
- Intent annotation
- Canonical normalization
- Object/meta-language distinction
- Morphisms

**Mathlib Context**

If `mathlib-context.md` exists at root, read it before designing the IR. It records per-claim Mathlib coverage from a pre-scan of the source. Use it to inform both chunk structure and proof scaffolding:
- `DIRECT` matches: the chunk may delegate to the existing Mathlib declaration; record the Mathlib module as an external dependency in the IR.
- `PARTIAL` matches: encode the bridging proof structure explicitly — the IR must carry enough step decomposition for the formalization agent to connect source reasoning to the named Mathlib lemmas.
- `NONE` matches: the chunk needs self-contained proof infrastructure; the IR must preserve full proof step detail.
- If an existing Lean project is present, note which relevant Mathlib modules are `IMPORTED` vs. `NEEDS_IMPORT` — this affects feasibility ordering of chunks.

**Library**

Unity maintains a global library of IR designs from prior runs at `~/.unity/library/ir-patterns/`. If any are present, they will be listed in the manifest appended below — use the `Read` tool to access them. You are not bound by them.

**Subagents**

You may spawn Generator subagents to assist with design decisions, deliberate on specific aspects of the source, propose alternative designs, or draft sub-languages which you aggregate. You may only output one final IR specification.

---

**Output**

Your output should be in `language/`. If you use multiple files, you must include a `README.md` describing each file. The README should be written primarily for downstream agents (semiformal translators, formalization agents, and the pipeline scheduler) and must be self-contained: downstream agents should require no context beyond `language/` and the source to correctly interpret and use the IR.

Before committing, append a brief entry to `DECISIONS.md` at root (create if absent) recording any key non-obvious IR design decisions and their rationale.

Once complete, run:
```
cd language
git add .
git commit -m "generation phase completed"
```

**IMPORTANT: Do not use pkill, killall, or any kill command targeting the unity-agent or claude process. Do not attempt to kill the pipeline or any parent process.**

Proceed as instructed.
